	-add: "audiomanager" integrated. However, there's

it looks more professionnal now LOL :D

may 13th, 04
	-fix: call glColor4ub( 255, 255, 255, 255 ) before calling
glEnable( GL_COLOR_MATERIAL ) and make glColorMaterial() work as
expected. Is this a driver's bug or a ATI video card's bug ?
	-add: FPS counting. Is this really useful ?
	-change: improving rendererDisplaySelection() and
rendererDisplayHighlight(). They now use only one call to glBegin()
and glEnd() pair.


may 9th, 04
	-add: work in progress OpenGL lighting. The glColorMaterial()
is really buggy so does my driver for ATI Radeon 9000 M. Setting
R200_NO_VTXFMT as bash variable can help debugging in some cases. I
replace the glColorMaterial() by many glMaterial*() and this costs
me a lot of time.

	-better keys handling, user can now translate the map in the
up-right direction by pressing both up and right at the same time
for example.


dec 27th, 03
	-added: "audiomanager". It can read M3U list and produce stereo
sound, terrible ! :-)


dec 13th, 03
	-document and clean up "graphicmanager" and "renderer"


dec 9th, 03
	-cleaned up the class "renderer"


dec 8th, 03
	-new version of "rendererGetSelectedWHFromLayer" which works by
dividing the map size by 2 (hence, the map surface by 4). It runs smoothly
and can deal with a 4000x4000 map. With the old method, it takes up to thirdty
seconds or more on my 2,4Ghz laptop (DRI activated in AGP4x speed) to
calculate the selected WH !


dec 7th, 03
	-a little bit of "experimental" codes were inserted in order to
fast render a big big map. The renderer now considers a row of same structures
as a big rectangular polygon instead of multiple seperate squares.


dec 6th, 03
	-graphicmanagerDisplaySelection modified, it now supports up to
16777216 differents object. Have you ever seen a 4096x4096 unit^2 map ? :-D

	-improved City::uiMouseButton, don't update the screen if the mouse
doesn't move -> save CPU
	-press ALT to multiply the translation and the rotation affects by 10
	-"configure" now checks for SDL, GL, and GLU library
	-"configure" now understands "--with-gl-prefix" (default=/usr/X11R6)

	-Ctrl or dragging out of map cancel zoning


nov 29th, 03
	-move the defines from main.hxx to the appropriate classes
	-added zone COM, and IND (just for fun, no simulation yet)


nov 15th, 03
	-replace OPENCITY_* "defines" by OC_*. Macros and enums still have the
same prefix.


nov 12th, 03
	-clean up the Square class
	-clean up the Structure class
	-clean up the Layer class
	-clean up the WEGStructure class
