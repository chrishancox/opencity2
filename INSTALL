------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL from sources on GNU/Linux
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, if you've downloaded a opencity-x.y.z.tar.bz2 file you need to extract
the sources by typing the following command at the prompt of your console:


	tar xjf opencity-x.y.tar.bz2


You do not need to perform this step if you  downloaded the sources from SVN.
The following commands will compile and install OpenCity on your system.
You need to be "root" when you call "make install".


	mkdir obj
	cd obj
	../configure --enable-debug
	make
	make install


Refer to the configure help file for more information about the configure's
options. In case you don't have a configure script, the following command
will create one:


	./autogen.sh


When the installation procedure have finished, you can launch OpenCity
from command-line with the instruction below:


	opencity


That's all, folks !


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL from a .package file on GNU/Linux
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The installer under GNU/Linux is named as opencity-x.y.z.package. Just make
it executable then run it.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PACKAGE on GNU/Linux
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please use the autopackage system. The specification file is inside the
"autopackage" directory. For more information, see:


	http://www.autopackage.org


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PACKAGE on Windows
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please use the InnoSetup system. There's already the InnoSetup configuration file
called "OpenCity.iss" at the source root. For more information, see:


	http://www.innosetup.com


Gook luck !
